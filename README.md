# Data Science Portfolio by Wouter Regter


## Python

- [**Kaggle: Customer Transaction PredictionÂ¶**](https://github.com/wouterregter/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Kaggle%20Customer%20Transaction%20Prediction/Kaggle%20Customer%20Transaction%20Prediction.ipynb): The goal of this project is predict which customers of Santander will make a specific transaction in the future. In this classification project, I cover both feature engineering and modelling. Because of the large dataset I trained a support vector classifier with kernel approximation using stochastic gradient descent learning and a LightGBM model.

- [**Kaggle: House Prices**](https://github.com/wouterregter/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Kaggle%20Housing%20Prices/Kaggle%20House%20Prices.ipynb): Kaggle competition with the aim of predicting house prices based on 79 features describing many of the aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The analysis includes feature engineering, advanced regression models like Random Forest and XGBoost, and hyperparameter tuning.


- ### Mini Projects 
	- ### NLP

		- [**Classifying Political Tweets as Clickbait**](https://github.com/wouterregter/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Mini%20Projects/Classifying%20News%20Articles%20as%20Clickbait.ipynb): Classifying and inspecting 23.448 tweets by 501 different U.S. senators mentioning news articles as clickbait/non-clickbait. This is done by training on a dataset of clickbait titles and predicting the dataset of tweets.

		- [**Examining Gender Bias in Song Lyrics**](https://github.com/wouterregter/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Mini%20Projects/Examining%20Gender%20Bias%20in%20Song%20Lyrics.ipynb): Comparing and examining gender bias in the song lyrics of Hip-Hop songs to the song lyrics of Electronic songs using Spacy and Word2Vec.

		- [**Comparing Series Release Strategies**](https://github.com/wouterregter/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Mini%20Projects/Comparing%20Series%20Release%20Strategies.ipynb): Examining which release strategy produces more positive discussions on Reddit, releasing all episodes at once or on a periodic basis, by comparing most distinct positive adjectives.

	- ### Image Processing
		- [**Analyzing Sentiment in Movies Over Time**](https://github.com/wouterregter/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Mini%20Projects/Analyzing%20Emotions%20in%20Movies%20Over%20Time.ipynb): Analyzing the distributions of sentiment extracted from a sample of movie trailers of different time periods using face and emotion detection algorithms.	

## R

- [**Examining Crowdsourcing Platform Behaviour**](https://rpubs.com/wouterregter/735365): An analysis of how task sequencing (a concept from cognitive psychology) impacts members of crowdsourcing platforms to participate in more complex tasks on the LEGO Ideas crowdsourcing platform using generized linear models (GLM).
