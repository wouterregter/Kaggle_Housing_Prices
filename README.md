This project contains my python code for the Kaggle Competition 'House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques'. 

The purpose of this project was to let me practice my data science skills, more specifically, my aim was to become more experienced 
with participating in kaggle projects, data exploration, feature engineering, regression models, ensemble methods and hyperparameter 
tuning.

The project contains three files:
(1) exploratory_data_analysis.py
(2) preprocessing_function.py
(3) modelling.py

The first file contains my code used for data exploration and feature engineering including the code for visualizations and 
documentation of my thought process. The second file contains a more general function, including all the preproccessing steps
in the first file, but without any visualizations and less details. The third file contains all the models I used to predict 
house prices, including advanced ensemble techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
